# Todo Manager

My first C program. A simple Todo manager.

I've used `scanf` which I can read is unsafe and at risk of buffer overflows, but I haven't figured out how to use `fgets` yet.

## Usage
```bash
.todo
```

If needed, set file executable file permission on todo binary:
```bash
chmod +x ./todo
```
